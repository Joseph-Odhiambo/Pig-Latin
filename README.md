* For words beginning with a vowel, add "ay" to the end.
* For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay". <br>
* If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
